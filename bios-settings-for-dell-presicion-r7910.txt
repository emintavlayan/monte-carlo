Dell Precision R7910 Server BIOS Settings
(Reality-based configuration for maximum Geant4/TOPAS throughput on a dual-socket rack workstation)

Context assumptions:
- Dell Precision R7910 (dual-socket Xeon E5 v3/v4 era)
- Linux-based HPC / compute node
- Geant4 / TOPAS Monte Carlo: CPU-bound, throughput-oriented, long-running jobs
- Rack-style workstation: sustained thermals, no aggressive power saving desired


SYSTEM BIOS > SATA Settings
- Embedded SATA: AHCI Mode
  # Correct. Simple, low-overhead path for a single SSD. Disk I/O is not a Geant4 bottleneck.

- Security Freeze Lock: Enabled
  # Irrelevant to performance. Fine to leave enabled.

- Write Cache: Enabled
  # Correct. Helps I/O bursts (output, phase space files). Use a UPS in a rack environment.

- Port A: Auto (Samsung SM871 SSD)
  # Fine. SSD performance is sufficient for Geant4 workloads.

- Port B / Port C: Auto
  # No impact unless devices are present.


SYSTEM BIOS > Processor Settings
- Logical Processor (Hyper-Threading): ENABLED
  # Reality: Geant4 can benefit from SMT, but gains are modest and workload-dependent.
  # On dual-socket Xeons, enabling HT often improves total histories/day slightly.
  # Final answer is empirical, but ENABLED is the reasonable default.

- QPI Speed: Maximum data rate
  # Correct. Reduces inter-socket penalty, important on dual-socket R7910.

- Alternate RTID: Disabled
  # Fine. No relevance to Geant4.

- Virtualization Technology (VT-x): ENABLED
  # Chosen specifically because it unlocks x2APIC on this BIOS.
  # VT-x has ~zero impact on bare-metal Geant4 performance when not running VMs.

- Address Translation Services (ATS): Disabled
  # Fine. ATS is irrelevant without IOMMU-heavy PCIe devices (not used by Geant4 CPU runs).

- Adjacent Cache Line Prefetch: ENABLED
  # Important correction.
  # Geant4 is NOT purely random access: geometry navigation, physics tables, and stacks
  # benefit from spatial locality. Disabling this often hurts throughput.

- Hardware Prefetcher: Enabled
  # Correct. Generally beneficial for Geant4’s mixed access patterns.

- DCU Streamer Prefetcher: Enabled
  # Correct. Helps tight loops and sequential access.

- DCU IP Prefetcher: Enabled
  # Correct. Helps pointer-heavy but structured code paths common in Geant4.

- Logical Processor Idling: Disabled
  # Correct for a rack system running continuous workloads.
  # Avoids latency and frequency ramp delays.

- Configurable TDP: Nominal
  # Correct and stable for sustained workloads.
  # “Maximum” can throttle under long runs if cooling headroom is marginal.

- x2APIC Mode: ENABLED
  # Correct.
  # Even below 256 logical CPUs, x2APIC improves interrupt scalability and reduces jitter
  # on multi-core, SMT-enabled systems.


SYSTEM BIOS > Memory Settings
- System Memory: 64 GB ECC DDR4 @ 2133 MHz
  # Fine. Capacity and ECC are appropriate for long Monte Carlo runs.

- System Memory Testing: Disabled
  # Boot-time only. No runtime impact.

- Memory Operating Mode: Optimizer Mode
  # Correct. Performance-oriented memory configuration.

- Node Interleaving: Disabled
  # Correct and important.
  # Preserves NUMA locality. Geant4 scales better when threads allocate local memory.
  # Rack servers benefit from NUMA-aware scheduling.

- Snoop Mode: HOME SNOOP
  # Important correction.
  # For throughput-oriented, mostly read-local workloads like Geant4,
  # Home Snoop provides better sustained bandwidth than Early Snoop.
  # Early Snoop favors latency, not total throughput.

- Video Memory: 16 MB
  # Irrelevant.


SYSTEM BIOS > System Profile Settings
- System Profile: Performance
  # Correct baseline for a rack compute node.

- CPU Power Management: Maximum Performance
  # Correct. Prevents frequency throttling.

- Memory Frequency: Maximum Performance
  # Correct. Memory bandwidth matters for parts of Geant4.

- Turbo Boost: Enabled
  # Critical. Improves both single-thread and all-core performance.

- Energy Efficient Turbo: Disabled
  # Correct. Avoids power-biased turbo behavior.

- C1E: Disabled
  # Correct. Avoids idle-state latency.

- C States: Disabled
  # Correct. Rack server running continuous jobs should not enter deep idle states.

- Collaborative CPU Performance Control: Disabled
  # Correct. Keeps performance policy in BIOS, not OS heuristics.

- Memory Patrol Scrub: Standard
  # Balanced choice.
  # Disabling can give small speedups, but for scientific / medical workloads,
  # Standard is appropriate for reliability on long runs.

- Memory Refresh Rate: 1x
  # Correct. Lowest refresh overhead, best bandwidth.

- Uncore Frequency: Maximum
  # Correct. Improves memory controller and interconnect performance.

- Energy Efficient Policy: Performance
  # Correct. Aligns all platform logic toward throughput.
