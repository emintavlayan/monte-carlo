[!] topas 4.2.1

[*] i have found docker image of topas here
    - https://hub.docker.com/r/opentopas/opentopas

[=] I have installed and run topas with docker
    > sudo groupadd docker
    > sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
    - restarted the system
    > docker pull opentopas/opentopas:v4.2.1
    - installed correctly

[=] then I created a test file
    - and tried to run topas
    - it started and then failed for Geant4 files
    - obviously.
